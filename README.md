## **Compiling Instructions**  

> *Note: If you're on Windows, you'll need a UNIX-like environment such as Cygwin to compile the source code.*  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
Run the following command in your terminal:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amar454/floppaos.git
```

### **2. Build the OS**  
Navigate to the repository directory and compile with:  
```bash
make all
```  
This will generate an **ISO image**, which can be attached to a **virtual machine** or written to a **USB device**.  

### **2a. Build and Run in QEMU** *(Recommended)*  
To compile and immediately launch the OS in **QEMU**, use:  
```bash
make qemu
```  
**QEMU** is the only vm floppaos is compatible with, due to issues with multiboot mmap on anything else... sorry

**3. Clean Up**  
To remove compiled binaries:  
```bash
make clean
```  

### **4. Clean Object Files** *(Without Deleting the ISO)*  
To remove C and assembly object files while keeping the ISO:  
```bash
make cleanobj
```  
*(This is the recommended step after compilation.)*
